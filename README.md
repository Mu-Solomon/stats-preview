## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It's been a bit challenging to add that purple filter to the image.ðŸ˜„
So I had to use some Googling...

```css
      filter:invert(0%) brightness(39%) sepia(27%) hue-rotate(232deg) saturate(1471%) contrast(92%);
```



### Useful resources

- [CSS Filter](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for knowing which color was used as the overlay on the image **reason**. I really liked the way it changed the purple color (#aa5cdb) to (filter:invert(0%) brightness(39%) sepia(27%) hue-rotate(232deg) saturate(1471%) contrast(92%);).
